        <h2>Here is a brief summary of Tata Madiba's life</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>1918-1939: Nelson Mandela was born in Mvezo, a village in South Africa, in 1918. He grew up in the nearby village of Qunu and was 
            the son of a tribal chief. Mandela received a traditional education and went on to attend college at Fort Hare University, one of 
            the few universities that accepted black students at the time. However, he was expelled after leading a student protest.
          </li>
          <li>1940-1949: In the 1940s, Mandela moved to Johannesburg and became involved in the anti-apartheid movement. He joined the 
            African National Congress (ANC) and helped to found its Youth League. Mandela's activism led to his arrest in 1952 and subsequent 
            trial, but he was eventually acquitted.
          </li>
          <li>
            1950s: Mandela continued to be involved in the anti-apartheid movement throughout the 1950s. He became a leader of the ANC and 
            helped to organize protests, boycotts, and other acts of civil disobedience. In 1956, he was arrested again and charged with high 
            treason along with 155 other activists. The trial lasted for four years before Mandela and his co-defendants were acquitted.
          </li>
          <li>
            1960-1964: In the early 1960s, Mandela and other ANC leaders realized that nonviolent protests were not enough to bring about 
            change in South Africa. They began to advocate for armed resistance, and Mandela helped to found Umkhonto we Sizwe 
            (Spear of the Nation), the military wing of the ANC. In 1962, Mandela was arrested again and sentenced to five years in prison for 
            inciting a workers' strike.
          </li>
          <li>
            1964-1982: In 1964, Mandela and several other Umkhonto we Sizwe leaders were tried and convicted of sabotage and conspiracy to 
            overthrow the government. Mandela was sentenced to life in prison and sent to Robben Island, a prison off the coast of Cape Town.
             He spent 18 years there before being transferred to other prisons.
          </li>
          <li>
            1983-1990: Mandela continued to be a symbol of the anti-apartheid movement while in prison. International pressure mounted for his 
            release, and he became a powerful symbol of resistance to apartheid. In 1985, South African President P.W. Botha offered Mandela 
            his freedom on the condition that he renounce violence, but Mandela refused.
          </li>
          <li>
            1990: In February 1990, South African President F.W. de Klerk lifted the ban on the ANC and other anti-apartheid groups and 
            released Mandela from prison after 27 years. Mandela emerged as a national and international hero and worked to negotiate an 
            end to apartheid and establish a democratic government in South Africa.
          </li>
          <li>
            1994: In 1994, South Africa held its first multi-racial elections, and Mandela was elected as the country's first black president. 
            He worked to bring about reconciliation between white and black South Africans and established the Truth and Reconciliation 
            Commission to investigate human rights abuses committed during apartheid.
          </li>
          <li>
            1999-2004: After serving one term as president, Mandela retired from politics but remained a prominent figure in South Africa 
            and around the world. He established the Nelson Mandela Foundation to promote social justice and equality, and he continued 
            to speak out on issues such as HIV/AIDS and poverty.
          </li>
          <li>
            2013: Nelson Mandela died on December 5, 2013, at the age of 95. He was mourned by people around the world as a hero and symbol of 
            the struggle against racism and oppression. His legacy continues to inspire people to fight for justice and equality.
